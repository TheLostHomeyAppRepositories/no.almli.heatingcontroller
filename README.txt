The 'Heating Controller' is a device for easily controlling temperatures and modes for thermostats and sockets for heating.

To switch between ‘Comfort’ and ‘ECO’ modes, just two flows are necessary: one ‘Comfort’ flow with comfort temperatures and modes, and one ‘ECO’ flow with ECO temperatures and modes.

Each ‘HeatingController’ device has its own schedule that can be changed from ‘Advanced settings’. Several devices can be used, each with their own schedule.

The app has support for public holidays for several countries, and utility prices for Nordic and Baltic countries.


To install the device:

1. Add the ‘Heating Controller’ device.
2. Go to ‘Advanced settings’ and adjust the schedule.
3. Select ‘Price area’ and ‘Currency’ for utility prices.
4. Select ‘Country for holidays’ for public and bank holidays.
